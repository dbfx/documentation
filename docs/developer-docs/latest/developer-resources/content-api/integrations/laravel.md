# Getting Started with Laravel

This integration guide is following the [Getting started guide](/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.md). We assume that you have completed [Step 8](/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#_8-publish-the-content) and therefore can consume the API by browsing this [url](http://localhost:1337/restaurants).

Should you wish to use standalone PHP, you may also be interested in the [PHP integration guide](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/content-api/integrations/php.html). 

This guide assumes you already have Laravel installed and are familiar with the basics of the framework.

## Install the Laravel-Strapi Laravel Package

```bash
composer require dbfx/laravel-strapi
```

This will install [Laravel-Strapi](https://github.com/dbfx/laravel-strapi), a Laravel specific package for interacting with Strapi.

You will also need to define your STRAPI_URL and STRAPI_CACHE_TIME in .env:

```
STRAPI_URL=http://localhost:1337
STRAPI_CACHE_TIME=3600
```


## Get your collection type

Execute a `GET` request on the `restaurant` Collection Type in order to fetch all your restaurants.

Be sure that you activated the `find` permission for the `restaurant` Collection Type.

_Request_

```php
$strapi = new Dbfx\LaravelStrapi();
$restaurants = $strapi->collection('restaurants');
```

You may now iterate over the $restaurants array which will contain all your restaurants. More options are available as well: 

```php
$restaurants = $strapi->collection('restaurants', $sortKey = 'id', $sortOrder = 'DESC', $limit = 20, $start = 0, $fullUrls = true);
```

## Accessing single type items

You may also access Single Type items as follows:

```php
$strapi = new Dbfx\LaravelStrapi();

// Fetch the full homepage array
$homepageArray = $strapi->single('homepage');

// Return just the ['content'] field from the homepage array
$homepageItem = $strapi->single('homepage', 'content');
```

## Collection by field

```php
$strapi = new Dbfx\LaravelStrapi();
$entries = $strapi->entriesByField('restaurants', 'slug', 'test-restuarant-name');
```

## Single item from collection

```php
$strapi = new Dbfx\LaravelStrapi();
$entry = $strapi->entry('restaurants', $id = 5);
```


## Conclusion

Here is how to request your Collection Types in Strapi using PHP. When you create a Collection Type or a Single Type you will have a certain number of REST API endpoints available to interact with.

There is more documentation available in the [README](https://github.com/dbfx/laravel-strapi) or in the [PHP integrations guide](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/content-api/integrations/php.html).
